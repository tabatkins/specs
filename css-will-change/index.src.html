Abstract: This document defines the 'will-change' property, which allows an author to inform the UA ahead of time of what kinds of changes they are likely to make to an element.  This allows the UA to optimize how they handle the element ahead of time, performing potentially-expensive work preparing for an animation before the animation actually begins.

<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction</h2>

	Modern CSS renderers perform a number of complex optimizations in order to render webpages quickly and efficiently.
	Unfortunately, employing these optimizations often has a non-trivial start-up cost,
	which can have a negative impact on the responsiveness of a page.

	<div class='example'>
		For example, when using CSS 3D Transforms to move an element around the screen,
		the element and its contents might be promoted to a “layer”,
		where they can render independently from the rest of the page and be composited in later.
		This isolates the rendering of the content so that the rest of the page doesn't have to be rerendered
		if the element’s transform is the only thing that changes between frames,
		and often provides significant speed benefits.

		However, setting up the element in a fresh layer is a relatively expensive operation,
		which can delay the start of a 'transform' animation by a noticeable fraction of a second.
	</div>

	The 'will-change' property defined in this specification allows an author to declare ahead-of-time what properties are likely to change in the future,
	so the UA can set up the appropriate optimizations some time before they're needed.
	This way, when the actual change happens,
	the page updates in a snappy manner.

Hinting at Future Behavior: the 'will-change' property</h2>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: will-change
	Value: auto | <<animateable-feature>>#
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: n/a
	Media: all
	Computed value: specified value
	</pre>

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>&lt;animateable-feature></dfn> = scroll-position | contents | <<custom-ident>></pre>

	The 'will-change' property provides a rendering hint to the user agent,
	stating what kinds of changes the author expects to perform on the element.
	This allows the user agent to perform ahead-of-time any optimizations necessary for rendering those changes smoothly,
	avoiding “jank” when the author does begin changing or animating that feature.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="will-change" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			Expresses no particular intent.

		<dt><dfn>scroll-position</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the author expects to animate or change the scroll position of the element in the near future.

		<dt><dfn>contents</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the author expects to animate or change something about the element's contents in the near future.

		<dt><dfn><<custom-ident>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the author expects to animate or change the property with the given name on the element in the near future.

			The <<custom-ident>> production used here excludes the keywords ''none'', ''all'', ''auto'', ''scroll-position'', and ''contents'',
			in addition to the keywords normally excluded from <<custom-ident>>.

			Note: Note that most properties will have no effect when specified,
			as the user agent doesn't perform any special optimizations for changes in most properties.
			It is still <em>safe</em> to specify them, though;
			it'll simply have no effect.

			If any non-initial value of a property would create a stacking context on the element,
			specifying that property in 'will-change' must create a stacking context on the element.

			If a non-initial value of a property would cause rendering differences on the element
			(such as using a different anti-aliasing strategy for text),
			the user agent should use that alternate rendering when the property is specified in 'will-change',
			to avoid sudden rendering differences when the property is eventually changed.
	</dl>


	<div class='example'>
		For example, setting 'opacity' to any value other than ''1'' creates a stacking context on the element.
		Thus, setting ''will-change: opacity'' also creates a stacking context,
		even if 'opacity' is <em>currently</em> still equal to ''1''.
	</div>

	The 'will-change' property has no <em>direct</em> effect on the element it is specified on,
	beyond the creation of stacking contexts as specified above.
	It is solely a rendering hint to the user agent,
	allowing it set up potentially-expensive optimizations for certain types of changes
	before the changes actually start occurring.
